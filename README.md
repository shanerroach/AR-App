# AR-App
The reason why we decided to create a Augmented reality software was simply to bring the physical world of humans to the cyber world of tech. If we could merge the two the advancement of our society would flourish.In this project will be using X-code as our terminal for the code. In our project the AR system works by implementing 3d images into the code as variables. Which in turn allows us to output them into a physical variable such as a card.  Syncing our phone camera gives us a way to visibly input the card variable to the physical card; that is in the cameras view; which gives the code a Que to start.
